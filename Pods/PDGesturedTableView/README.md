PDGesturedTableView
===================

Great Mailbox-like UITableView subclass.

![Example app running on 2 iPhones](https://raw.github.com/Dromaguirre/PDGesturedTableView/master/Images/screenshot-1.png)

Check out the **example app**. You'll see implementing this powerful control isn't hard at all.

## Features

- **Multiple actions** in a single slide depending on the lenght the user slided (Mailbox feature).
- ðŸ†• **Tap and hold** to move cells (Mailbox feature).
- A **UIView** can be set to be shown **when there's no content** on the table view (Mailbox feature).
- Super easy **customization**.
- A **left and right margin** can be set to let the user swipe between different table views.
- **Block-driven**. No silly delegates :)

## CocoaPods

You can easily install PDGesturedTableView through CocoaPods adding the following to your Podfile:

	pod 'PDGesturedTableView'
